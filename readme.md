This project is based on the requirements of the project 2 of www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript. It's an online messaging service, users are able to sign up, sign in and sign out, are able to see and join existing channels (chatrooms) and also to create new channels. Users joined the same channel, can send and receive messages with one another in real time. The code is written using python, flask and sockets. It doesn't use a database, the data are stored in server's ram.
